# Handling user input with forms

* To handle some data from the user we need HTML forms.
* There are two ways of form generation in Angular, Reactive and Template driven.
* Both allow us to create the visuals for the form, and validate its inputs.
* For the given training, template driven forms will be used, as it is the most straightforward
and quickest way of generating a form.
* For more information on Reactive forms, Angular official documentation can be found here:
[https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms).

Let's look into example:

* Now, letâ€™s create a new component named DogForm in our application!
