# Exercise 1

* Add an onInit hook in your AppComponent.
* On component init, a function named `fetchDoggos()` should be called.
* The function should simply provide us a list of objects and set its value to `this.doggos`. Later, we will replace it with an API call.
* Donâ€™t forget to still initialize `this.doggos` as an empty array in the beginning of your component!
