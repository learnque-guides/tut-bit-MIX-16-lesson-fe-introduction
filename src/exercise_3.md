# Exercise 3

In category component when you are using dropdown after subject selection you still see `Select category`. Implement functionality in category component so it would be possible to change `Select category` label in dropdown when you have selected subject. For example if you selecting `Science` subject you need to replace `Select category` to `Science`.
